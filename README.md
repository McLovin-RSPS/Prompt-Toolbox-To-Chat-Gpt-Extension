# AutoPromptFill
AutoPromptFill is a powerful Chrome extension designed to enhance your productivity with [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com). This tool automatically fills prompts that you've created using the [Prompt Toolbox](https://prompttoolbox.com). Now you can quickly fill your prompts without the hassle, freeing up your time for more creative work.

## How to Use
1. Download and extract the repository into a new folder.
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Ensure that "Developer mode" (top right toggle) is turned ON.
4. Click "Load unpacked" (top left) and select the folder containing AutoPromptFill files.

The new "autofill" button will AUTOMATICALLY appear on [Prompt Toolbox](https://PromptToolbox.com) next to the existing "copy to clipboard" button when you view a prompt.

## TODO
Once more testing and bug fixing are done, I will submit it to the Chrome Store for easier installation and updates.
